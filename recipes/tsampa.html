        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Tsampa is made from roasted barley. Tsampa is a Tibetan staple food. The most common way to eat tsampa is to mix it by hand with butter tea.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>4 cups of dried pearled barley</li>
            <li>butter</li>
        
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Wash the barley thoroughly with water. Drain off the water.</li>
            <li>Spread it out on a flat surface and let it dry.</li>
            <li>Once it is mostly dry, you are ready to roast.</li>
            <li>Heat sand on high on the stove.</li>
            <li>Pour barley on top of the heated sand and roast the barley, shaking it together with the sand in the pan.</li>
            <li>Sift out the sand from the roasted barley using a sifter.</li>
            <li>Repeat the sifting process 3 to 4 times to properly sift out the sand from the roasted barley.</li>
            <li>Grind the clean roasted barley.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>If you don't want to go through the process of making Tsampa, try your luck finding some readymade being sold at Tibetan shop or restaurant.</p>
